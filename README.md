With a strong academic background in Mathematics from King’s College London and experience in data analysis, problem-solving, and business operations, I am eager to contribute my skills to your team. Many of my university modules involved group projects, which enhanced my teamwork and communication skills, as I regularly collaborated with peers to tackle complex problems.
Beyond my academic studies, I have gained valuable real-world experience through running an independent business reselling luxury goods and services. Managing high sales volumes—up to 40–50 transactions per day—required me to liaise with manufacturers, oversee logistics, and ensure efficient product distribution.
Additionally, I completed a virtual investment banking internship, where I developed skills in company valuation, financial modelling, and data analysis. 
Coming to the end of a 8-week intensive Data Technician Skills Bootcamp with Just IT Training. Looking to consolidate my skills further to become a data analyst. Working on several projects to develop my online GitHub portfolio whereby I can demonstrate my skills in Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI and Tableau.
I am particularly drawn to the data analytics industry because it aligns with my analytical mindset, problem-solving abilities, and passion for working with data. Given my experience in data interpretation, financial modelling, and business operations, I believe I am well-suited for this an opportnity in this field.
